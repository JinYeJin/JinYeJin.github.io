These days I have lots of thinkings about what I like or dislike. I think this question is the most important thing in my life. For example, I choose my major just fit my grade in high school. And I guess many high school students do the same thing as me. It's not a big deal when you are in a University, but when you come out to society it's gonna be a big deal. Because you don't like your major not much if you trying to get a job, you cannot feel the passion of it. And know I've been through this situation. Of course, there are so many businessmen who do their works well even if they don't like it. But for me, That's the hardest thing to do. So, These days, I seriously find out what I really want to do.
